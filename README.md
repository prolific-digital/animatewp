### Understanding Animation "From"

The animations in Prolific Animations work by animating the block "from" a specified state to its final state. This means that you define where the animation starts, and the block transitions from that state to its natural position and appearance.

#### Example: Fade In from Left

To create a "Fade In from Left" animation:

1. **Enable Animation**: Toggle this option to enable the animation.
2. **Animation Type**: Select "Fade In".
3. **X Position (PX)**: Set the X position to -100 (or any negative value) to start the block to the left.
4. **Animation Duration**: Set the duration to 1 second (or any preferred duration).
5. **Animation Easing**: Choose an easing function, such as "Power1.inOut".

This setup will make the block start 100 pixels to the left of its natural position and fade in while moving to its final position over the course of 1 second.
