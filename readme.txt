**Advanced Animation Settings**

Customize your animations with the following options:

1. **Enable Animation**: Toggle this option to enable the animation.
2. **Loop**: Enable this option to loop the animation.
3. **Auto Play**: Enable this option to auto-play the animation.
4. **Animation Duration**: Set the duration of the animation in seconds.
5. **Animation Delay**: Set the delay before the animation starts in seconds.
6. **Animation Easing**: Choose the easing function for the animation.
7. **X Position (PX)**: Set the X position for the animation in pixels.
8. **Y Position (PX)**: Set the Y position for the animation in pixels.
9. **X Percent (%)**: Set the X position as a percentage for the animation.
10. **Y Percent (%)**: Set the Y position as a percentage for the animation.
11. **Scale**: Set the scale for the animation.
12. **Rotation (Degrees)**: Set the rotation for the animation in degrees.
13. **Opacity**: Set the opacity for the animation.
14. **Repeat**: Set the number of times the animation should repeat.
15. **Yo-Yo**: Enable this option to make the animation reverse on repeat.
16. **Enable Scroll Trigger**: Enable this option to trigger the animation on scroll.
17. **Scroll Trigger Start**: Select the start point for the scroll trigger.
18. **Scroll Trigger Start Offset (PX)**: Set an offset for the scroll trigger start point in pixels.

**Understanding Animation "From"**

The animations in AnimateWP work by animating the block "from" a specified state to its final state. This means that you define where the animation starts, and the block transitions from that state to its natural position and appearance.

**Example: Fade In from Left**

To create a "Fade In from Left" animation:

1. **Enable Animation**: Toggle this option to enable the animation.
2. **Animation Type**: Select "Fade In".
3. **X Position (PX)**: Set the X position to -100 (or any negative value) to start the block to the left.
4. **Animation Duration**: Set the duration to 1 second (or any preferred duration).
5. **Animation Easing**: Choose an easing function, such as "Power1.inOut".

This setup will make the block start 100 pixels to the left of its natural position and fade in while moving to its final position over the course of 1 second.
